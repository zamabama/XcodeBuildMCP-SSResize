# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Add Smithery support for packaging/distribution.
- Add DAP-based debugger backend and simulator debugging toolset (attach, breakpoints, stack, variables, LLDB command).
- Add session-status MCP resource with session identifiers.
- Add UI automation guard that blocks UI tools when the debugger is paused.

### Changed
- Migrate to Zod v4.
- Improve session default handling (reconcile mutual exclusivity and ignore explicit undefined clears).

### Fixed
- Update UI automation guard guidance to point at `debug_continue` when paused.
- Fix tool loading bugs in static tool registration.

## [1.16.0] - 2025-12-30
- Remove dynamic tool discovery (`discover_tools`) and `XCODEBUILDMCP_DYNAMIC_TOOLS`. Use `XCODEBUILDMCP_ENABLED_WORKFLOWS` to limit startup tool registration.
- Add MCP tool annotations to all tools.

## [1.14.0] - 2025-09-22
- Add video capture tool for simulators

## [1.13.1] - 2025-09-21

## [1.12.3] - 2025-08-22
- Pass environment variables to test runs on device, simulator, and macOS via an optional testRunnerEnv input (auto-prefixed as TEST_RUNNER_).

## [1.12.2] - 2025-08-21
### Fixed
- **Clean tool**: Fixed issue where clean would fail for simulators

## [1.12.1] - 2025-08-18
### Improved
- **Sentry Logging**: No longer logs domain errors to Sentry, now only logs MCP server errors.

## [1.12.0] - 2025-08-17
### Added
- Unify project/workspace and sim id/name tools into a single tools reducing the number of tools from 81 to 59, this helps reduce the client agent's context window size by 27%!
- **Selective Workflow Loading**: New `XCODEBUILDMCP_ENABLED_WORKFLOWS` environment variable allows loading only specific workflow groups in static mode, reducing context window usage for clients that don't support MCP sampling (Thanks to @codeman9 for their first contribution!)
- Rename `diagnosics` tool and cli to `doctor`
- Add Sentry instrumentation to track MCP usage statistics (can be disabled by setting `XCODEBUILDMCP_SENTRY_DISABLED=true`)
- Add support for MCP setLevel handler to allow clients to control the log level of the MCP server
